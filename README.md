# Vedantu Assignment

#### Problem Statement
(Front-end Developer challenge)

It was required to make a page like github.com -


## Solution

##### Installation


```bash
npm install
```

Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

Production Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```


##### Stacks Used
* ReactJs (pure form, no extra helper modules used)
* Github (for version controlling)

Boilder Plate : facebook's create-react-app
<br>

##### Javascript/CSS Modules used
* Vanilla React
* whatwg-fetch: for fetching data from API
* Bootstrap : Only for the Glyphicon

No Other modules are used.

##### Custom components
* DropDown button was custom developed and implemented
* Search query based on the language, repo type and search text results as well as custom text message for every combinations.


### Technical Approach
----------------------
The following is the terminology for the development used:
The Layout is divided onto two panels:
* Left Panel : consists of the user profile layout
* Right Panel : consists of Repository list data

##### Features
* There are few Icons like: fork icon, licence icon etc. are replaced with dummy icon
* The header bar implementation is not done, as mentioned in the question.
* There is a bit discrepancy in the font and colors of the page as exact matching palette could not be found. So they were improvised.
* The page is responsive and the bio section comes on the top in the mobile screen (as asked in the question)
* The tick icon in the dropdown button in the query section is impllemnted as done in the original github page.
* The query section (Overview,Repositories,Projects...) is horizontally scrollable as in the original github page.

The code was done on the _develop_ branch and later merged to the _master_ branch

##### Time management

* The Assignment took 6.5hrs to complete. It includes all the research work, code structuring and github setup.
* I started the project at 5:15 PM and completed till 11:45PM.
* However the assignment report is not included in the 7.5hrs. The report was prepared at 4:00PM of the next day.

**Kindly check the git commit list as the proof of the same**


### Conclusion
----------------------
* I was able to complete all the tasks mentioned in the question.
* I successfully build the frontend of the project.
* I included the deplyment and development scripts for the project.
